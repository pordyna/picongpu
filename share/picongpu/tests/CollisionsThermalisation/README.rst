Collisions: Testing example thermalization
==========================================

In this example there are two particle populations â€” electrons and ions.
They are thermally initialized with different temperatures and their temperatures get closer to each other with time.
The usual PIC steps are disabled (there is no field solver and no pusher).
The thermalization happens solely due to the binary collisions.
We enable inter-collisions for ions and electrons as well as collisions between the two species.
