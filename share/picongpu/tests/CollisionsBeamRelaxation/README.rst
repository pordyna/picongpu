Collisions: Testing example beam relaxation
===========================================

A population of electrons with a very small temperature and a drift velocity (the beam) is colliding with ions.
Due to the collisions the velocity distribution of electrons is changing and the drift momentum is transferred into the electron transversal momentum and partially into ion momenta.
In this test only the inter-collisions (between ions and electrons) are enabled.
